## What is Trojan Dropper?

A Trojan dropper, also known as a dropper, is a malicious program structured to deliver and install malware to a victim’s phone, device, or computer. Droppers are usually Trojans. These Trojans are programs that appear as an application or software that is beneficial to the user. There are two ways the Trojan-dropper functions: 

1. The dropper stores the malware code so virus scanners cannot detect it.
2. The dropper downloads and installs the malware onto the targeted computer once activated.

## Types of Trojan-Dropper

There are two types of trojan droppers. They include:

* **Persistent droppers:** This type of trojan dropper is the most dangerous. When the device is checked, it copies itself into a hidden file. However, even if removed, it reinstalls itself upon rebooting the system.
* **Nonpersistent droppers:** This type of dropper is less dangerous. Once uninstalled through payload from the infected device, it cannot reinstall itself.

## How Does a Device/Computer Get Infected with Trojan-Dropper?

A Trojan displays itself as a harmless app, software, or program to penetrate a computer or device. However, hidden beneath its legitimate surface are malicious codes that can harm your devices. 

It is important to note that the trojan dropper is harmless itself, but the malware it deploys is harmful to your computer or device. Trojan attacks begin with downloading and installing the supposed legitimate software while it goes ahead to execute the malware.

## What Else Can I Do to Avoid Trojan-Dropper Malware?

There is no guarantee that your device will never be affected by a Trojan dropper. However, you can massively reduce the chances of it by considering and implementing the right security measures on your devices.

1. **Use a firewall**: A firewall will analyze and filter data, programs, and files received and sent by your device via the internet. This will help reduce infection of dropper malware.
2. **Use an updated and reliable antivirus:** It is highly recommended to use a good quality antivirus and keep it updated to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. A good antivirus like [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) will fill gaps in its defenses and offer extra protection against sneakier security risks.
3. **Be careful when installing programs/software apps:** When installing apps and programs, read through the screen and the license agreements. Some installation options indicate any third-party software installed alongside your apps or programs.
