I want to try the short free software. I do have a higher than a basic Norton antivirus installed.  
(1) will the MalwareFox interfere with Norton?  
(2) My Norton subscription allows for coverage for up to 5 computers. I do plan on getting a new laptop. I will try to “Deep Clean” laptop that is not Upgraded to Windows 10\. That device will never be connected to the internet. I will use it for scanning, using as a photo editing device and possibility as a fax over a phone line. Will I be able to download Malware Fox to a new laptop and or a desk top?  
I eagerly await your response.  
Respectfully,  
Michael Breed
